I'm a CS master's student with a passion for turning data into actionable insights and crafting robust software solutions. With three years of diverse work experience, I've honed my skills as a software developer and data scientist.

My expertise spans multiple programming languages including Python, Java, C/C++, JavaScript, and SQL. I'm well-versed in utilizing frameworks and tools such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, REST, Flask, Redis, MongoDB, GNU, GDB, Git, Kubernetes, and Docker to build cutting-edge applications.

Currently pursuing my master's, I'm eagerly seeking full-time opportunities starting in 2024 to apply my knowledge and skills in a dynamic work environment.
