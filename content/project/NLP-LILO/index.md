title: Relationship Extraction tackling Large Input Large Output (LILO) problem
summary: Utilized context-aware summarization to improve the performance of relation extraction on Electronic Health Records (EHR) which are known to be long and pose a challenge for state-of-the-art NLP systems. I have Utilized the 2010 Relations Dataset for the research.
