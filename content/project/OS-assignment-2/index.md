title: xv6 Memory Management Mastery - On-Demand Loading and Copy-On-Write Brilliance
summary: Tackled advanced process memory management in the xv6 operating system, implementing dynamic on-demand paging and the innovative Copy-On-Write (CoW) Optimization. Features include dynamic On-Demand Binary Loading, a robust Page Fault Handler ensuring continuous process operation, efficient On-Demand Heap Memory loading, and a strategic Page Swapping to Disk mechanism to tackle memory constraints. Enhanced the fork() system call conserving memory by creating separate yet identical spaces for parent-child processes using CoW. Key technologies- C Programming, OS Concepts, Memory Management, Page Fault Handling, and CoW Optimization.
