title: QEMU RISC-V Bootloader Mastery and Enhancing Security and Functionality
summary: Delved into the OS boot process using the QEMU Emulator, creating a custom bootloader for the xv6 OS kernel. Utilized GDB Debugger for Boot ROM inspection and crafted a bootloader using Linker Scripts and Assembler Programming (Assembly). Enabled C code execution through stack setup and introduced user flexibility to boot different OSs. Enhanced security using RISC-V's PMP Configuration and a custom Secure Boot Implementation. Technologies involved- QEMU, GDB, RISC-V, Assembly, C Programming, Linker Scripts, PMP, and Secure Boot
