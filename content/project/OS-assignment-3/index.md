title: xv6 ThreadMaster - Dynamic User-Level Threads and Smart Scheduling
summary: Undertook the implementation of user-level threads within xv6 processes by developing a comprehensive User-Level Threading Library (ULTLib). This library allowed for the segmentation of kernel-backed threads into multiple user-level threads with efficient management. Key tasks included ULTLib Initialization, dynamic Thread Creation with precise context management, intelligent Thread Switching and Scheduling incorporating multiple algorithms like round-robin and priority scheduling, and advanced Thread Yielding and Destruction capabilities. Additionally, crafted a new xv6 system call, ctime, tapping into the RISC-V register for accurate timing information. Core technologies and tools encompassed- C Programming, Assembly Language (RISC-V), OS Concepts, Thread Management, and System Calls.
