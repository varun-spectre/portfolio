title: Image Recognition as Cloud Service
summary: The service will take in images in the PNG format from users, use the deep learning model to perform image recognition, and return the top prediction from the model to the user as plain text. The importance of this service is to provide a scalable and efficient solution for image recognition that can be accessed remotely by users, without the need for them to train their own models or have access to specialized hardware.
